# Slow Pedal
A DIY alternative to Vidami for guitar practice.


Features:

YouTube or local videos on your computer. Much like the Vimi petal, the slow pedal allows you to control video with a tap of your foot. Including

Play/pause.
Speed up/slow down.
Loop set/release.
Lincoln or shorten the loop.
Shift the loop left right.

This is actually more functionality than the Romy, and you can build the pedal very cheaply.
